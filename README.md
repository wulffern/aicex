Head over to [wulffern.github.io/aicex](https://wulffern.github.io/aicex) for
the docs.

# Files and folders

This is a repository that contains links to other github repositories with
analog designs. Most of the designs have been developed as part of the NTNU
course TFE4188 - Advanced Integrated Circuits.

``` sh
ci/       # Continous integration. Mostly check of the tutorials
docker/   # Dockerfiles to create a container with the tools
ip/       # all the IPs, config.yaml contains the links
tests/    # Makefile used for installation of the tools
```

# Installing, and usage 

For a detailed scription of installing the tools, see
<http://analogicus.com/aic2026/2025/10/25/The-Tools.html>

For a description of the usage, see
<https://analogicus.com/aic2026/2025/10/26/Sky130nm-tutorial.html>


# For the impatient

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wulffern/aicex.git
```

I assume you have docker installed, or have windows subsystem for linux. 

> &#x26A0;  It's a very good idea to check what's inside scripts before you run them

``` sh
./run.sh
```

You should now see a cyan "aicex@~$" terminal.

Check that you can open a new X terminal 

``` sh
xterm &
```

``` sh
python3 -m pip install cicconf cicspi cicsim
cd ip
cicconf clone --https
```

You should now be able to run the tutorial at 
<https://analogicus.com/aic2026/2025/10/26/Sky130nm-tutorial.html>

# Known issues

## Xschem

* Netlisting seems to be done not by pin number, but by order of B's in .sym.
  Also, I've experienced different ordering for subckts, and for top cell

* Be careful of x1[5:0] notation. Xschem does not automatically discover if
  there is another same x<nr>. I would recommend always uniquely naming
  instances with bus notation 

## docker
* The aicex user has a uid of 1000, however, if you try and run it on a machine
  with a different uid for your user, then it does not seem to work. Don't know
  how to fix it yet.

## Ngspice

* In 44.2 there is a missing \$LDFLAGS on the line `shell g++ --shared $v_objs
  $v_lib -pthread -lpthread -o $soname` to compile on my M4 mac
