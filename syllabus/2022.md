# TFE4188 - Advanced integrated Circuits Syllabus 2022

## Book: Analog Integrated Circuit Design
Authors: Carusone, Tony Chan Johns, David Martin, Kenneth [at akademia.no](https://www.akademika.no/analog-integrated-circuit-design/carusone-tony-chan/johns-david/martin-kenneth/9781118092330)

This is one of the best books in
existence on analog integrated circuit design, maybe rivaled by Razavi's [Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Analog-CMOS-Integrated-Circuits/dp/0072380322)

**All information in chapters 1 - 6,9,10,15,17 are part of the curriculum for the
exam. These chapter were covered in TFE4152 Design of Integrated Circuits, and
TFE4187 Analog CMOS1**
